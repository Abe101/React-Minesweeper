if we clik on a cell and it has a mine, ja ghr ja bachon ka khel nhi hai
if we clik on a cell and it doesnt have a mine, u open it, 2 things can happen ( i.e: more bitching )

if a square adjacent to it has a mine, then show total number of mines
if no adjacent cells have a mine then we unhide it and open all cells next to it and check for information

if we clik on a mine on our first turn, reset the board and try again
